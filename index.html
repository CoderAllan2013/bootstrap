        <p>Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the
          entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on
          the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the
          servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring
          celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there
          is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.

      <p>I watched it today with my kids and they loved it. You should have a minimal previous understanding of the
        story, or you will miss 40% of the fun. You should watch Infinity War, Civil War, Black Panther, Age of Ultron,
        Ant-Man and the Wasp before watching Avengers: Endgame. The entire movie pays homage to most of the other Marvel
        superhero movies. You will enjoy it a lot. There is, at the beginning of the movie, a (spoiler alert) head
        dismemberment that is quite impressive. The movie is based on the most-talked action-packed Sci-fi series. The
        movie shows how the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore balance to the
        universe. The movie is lengthy, and it does run for 3 hours all worthwhile.

      <p>The story shows how a young lion prince, after the murder of his father, flees his kingdom only to learn the
        true meaning of responsibility and bravery. This movie is worth a watch for its gorgeous visuals and
        cinematography. The music was phenomenal. Beyonc√© really brought Nala to live but the show stealers were Timon
        and Pumba. Kids would love it.
